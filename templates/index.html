  Welcome to my blog. It is black. It is powered by a cool <a href="http://golang.org">Go</a>
  program called <a href="https://github.com/rsesek/blackblog">blackblog</a>. My
  name is Inigo Montoya; you killed my father, prepare to die. This blog is about
  many things, but most importantly, it is about nothing.
